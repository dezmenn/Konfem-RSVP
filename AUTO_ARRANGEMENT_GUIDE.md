## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### Auto-Arrangement Endpoint
```
POST /api/tables/events/:eventId/auto-arrange
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "respectRelationships": true,
  "balanceBrideGroomSides": true,
  "considerDietaryRestrictions": false,
  "keepFamiliesTogether": true,
  "maxGuestsPerTable": 8
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully arranged 24 guests across 3 tables",
  "arrangedGuests": 24
}
```

### Service Layer

#### TableService (`rsvp-backend/src/services/TableService.ts`)
- `autoArrangeGuests()`: Main auto-arrangement algorithm
- `groupGuestsForArrangement()`: Groups guests based on relationships and preferences
- Handles both production database and demo mode

#### MockTableService (`rsvp-backend/src/services/MockTableService.ts`)
- Demo mode implementation with in-memory data
- Same interface as production service
- Perfect for testing and demonstrations

## Auto-Arrangement Algorithm

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Retrieve all guests for the event
   - Get available (unlocked) tables
   - Validate that tables are available

2. **Guest Unassignment**
   - Clear all existing table assignments
   - Prepare for fresh arrangement

3. **Guest Grouping**
   - Group by family relationships if enabled
   - Consider bride/groom side preferences
   - Respect dietary restrictions if enabled
   - Split large groups that exceed table capacity

4. **Table Assignment**
   - Assign guest groups to tables sequentially
   - Respect table capacity limits
   - Move to next table when current is full
   - Handle overflow gracefully

5. **Result Reporting**
   - Return success/failure status
   - Provide detailed message about arrangement
   - Report number of guests successfully arranged

### Grouping Logic:

```typescript
// Family key generation
const familyKey = `${guest.brideOrGroomSide}-${guest.relationshipType}`;

// Examples:
// "bride-Parent" - Parents of the bride
// "groom-Sibling" - Siblings of the groom  
// "bride-Friend" - Friends of the bride
```

## Integration with Venue Management

### IntegratedVenueManager Integration
The auto-arrangement feature is seamlessly integrated into the existing venue management system:

1. **Mode Selection**: Added "Auto Arrangement" tab alongside "Venue Elements" and "Tables"
2. **Data Synchronization**: Shares table data with other venue management modes
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately across all modes
4. **Consistent UI**: Maintains the same design language and user experience

## Usage Instructions

### For Event Organizers:

1. **Access the Feature**
   - Navigate to Venue Management
   - Click on "Auto Arrangement" tab

2. **Configure Options**
   - Check desired arrangement preferences
   - Set maximum guests per table (typically 6-10)
   - Consider your event's specific needs

3. **Run Auto-Arrangement**
   - Click "Auto Arrange" button
   - Wait for completion (usually 1-3 seconds)
   - Review the automatic assignments

4. **Manual Adjustments**
   - Drag guests between tables as needed
   - Move guests to unseated list if necessary
   - Fine-tune the arrangement to your preferences

5. **Validation**
   - Check table capacity indicators
   - Ensure no tables are over-capacity
   - Verify guest satisfaction with seating

### Best Practices:

1. **Start with Auto-Arrangement**
   - Use auto-arrangement as a starting point
   - Let the algorithm handle the bulk assignment
   - Make manual adjustments afterward

2. **Consider Relationships**
   - Enable "Keep Families Together" for family events
   - Use "Respect Relationships" for mixed events
   - Balance bride/groom sides for weddings

3. **Table Capacity Planning**
   - Set realistic maximum guests per table
   - Consider table size and comfort
   - Leave some buffer for last-minute additions

4. **Lock Important Tables**
   - Lock VIP tables or special arrangements
   - Prevent auto-arrangement from changing critical assignments
   - Use locked tables for head table, family tables, etc.
