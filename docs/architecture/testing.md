# Testing Strategy

The project has a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The `__tests__` directories in each of the main components contain a wide range of tests that are designed to ensure the quality and reliability of the code.

## Backend Testing

The `rsvp-backend` has a particularly thorough testing suite, with tests for:

*   **Models**: Ensuring that the data models are working correctly.
*   **Repositories**: Testing the data access layer to ensure that it is interacting with the database correctly.
*   **Services**: Testing the business logic of the application to ensure that it is working as expected.
*   **Integration**: End-to-end tests that cover the entire application, from the API endpoints to the database.

## Frontend Testing

The `rsvp-web` and `rsvp-mobile` applications also have their own test suites, which are focused on testing the user interface components and ensuring that they are working correctly. These tests use a combination of Jest and React Testing Library to test the components in isolation and to ensure that they are rendering correctly and responding to user interactions as expected.
