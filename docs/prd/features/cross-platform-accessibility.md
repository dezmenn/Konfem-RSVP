# Feature: Cross-Platform Accessibility

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the accessibility standards and guidelines for the RSVP Planning App across all platforms, including web and mobile. Our goal is to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and use our application effectively. We will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as our primary standard.

## 2. Core Principles (POUR)

Our accessibility strategy is built on four core principles:

*   **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
*   **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
*   **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
*   **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## 3. Cross-Platform Accessibility Standards

The following standards apply to both the web (`rsvp-web`) and mobile (`rsvp-mobile`) applications.

### 3.1. Keyboard Accessibility
*   **Guideline**: All interactive elements must be fully operable through a keyboard interface.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Logical and intuitive tab order for all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields).
    *   Visible focus indicators for all focusable elements.
    *   No "keyboard traps" where a user cannot navigate away from a component using the keyboard.
    *   Standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Enter` to activate buttons, `Space` for checkboxes) must be supported.

### 3.2. Screen Reader Support
*   **Guideline**: The application must be fully compatible with common screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS for web; VoiceOver for iOS, TalkBack for Android).
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Semantic HTML/Components**: Use correct semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, etc.) and appropriate ARIA roles where necessary.
    *   **Alternative Text**: All non-decorative images must have descriptive `alt` text.
    *   **Labels and Instructions**: All form inputs must have associated, visible labels. Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for elements that need more descriptive names (e.g., icon-only buttons).
    *   **Dynamic Content**: Changes in content (e.g., search results, status messages) must be announced to screen readers, using ARIA live regions (`aria-live`).

### 3.3. Visual Design & Color
*   **Guideline**: The visual presentation should be clear and adaptable.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Color Contrast**: Text and interactive elements must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background (WCAG AA).
    *   **Color as Information**: Color should not be the sole means of conveying information. Provide alternative indicators like text labels, icons, or patterns (e.g., the relationship color coding is supplemented by text).
    *   **Text Resizing**: Users must be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
    *   **Responsive Design**: Layouts must adapt to different screen sizes and orientations without requiring horizontal scrolling.

### 3.4. Touch and Pointer Gestures
*   **Guideline**: Interactions should be easy to perform regardless of input method.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Touch Target Size**: All touch targets must be at least 44x44 CSS pixels (as recommended by WCAG) to be easily activated. (Note: The mobile implementation already exceeds this with 60px+ targets).
    *   **Complex Gestures**: Any functionality that uses a complex gesture (e.g., pinch-to-zoom) must also be operable by a simpler method (e.g., zoom buttons).

## 4. Platform-Specific Guidelines

### 4.1. Web (`rsvp-web`)
*   **Page Structure**: Use proper heading levels (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) to structure content hierarchically.
*   **Landmarks**: Use ARIA landmark roles (`banner`, `navigation`, `main`, `complementary`, `contentinfo`) to define regions of the page.
*   **Modals and Dialogs**: When a modal is open, focus must be trapped within it. The `Escape` key should close the modal.

### 4.2. Mobile (`rsvp-mobile`)
*   **Accessibility Properties**: Utilize platform-specific accessibility properties (e.g., `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityRole` in React Native).
*   **Device Features**: Respect device-level accessibility settings, such as font size preferences and high-contrast modes.
*   **Safe Area**: Ensure interactive elements are placed within the safe area of the device to avoid being obscured by notches or system bars.

## 5. Testing and Validation

Accessibility will be a continuous part of our development and testing process.
*   **Automated Testing**: Integrate accessibility scanning tools (e.g., Axe) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Manual Testing**:
    *   Perform regular keyboard-only navigation tests.
    *   Conduct screen reader testing on both web and mobile platforms.
*   **User Testing**: Involve users with disabilities in our testing process where possible.
