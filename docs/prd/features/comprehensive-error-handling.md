# User Story: Comprehensive Error Handling

## As a: Developer
## I want: The application to have comprehensive error handling
## So that: It can gracefully manage unexpected issues, provide informative feedback, and maintain stability.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   **WhatsApp API Error Recovery**: The system should implement robust error recovery and retry mechanisms for WhatsApp API calls, ensuring message delivery even with transient issues.
*   **User-Friendly Error Messages**: All user-facing errors should be clear, concise, and actionable, guiding the user on how to resolve the issue or what to expect.
*   **Network Connectivity Handling**: The application should gracefully handle network connectivity issues (e.g., offline mode, re-connection attempts) without data loss or crashes.
*   **Performance Optimization for Large Datasets**: The system should maintain optimal performance even when handling large guest lists or complex seating arrangements, with appropriate error handling for performance bottlenecks.
*   **Graceful Degradation**: In case of service failures or critical errors, the application should degrade gracefully, providing essential functionality or informative messages rather than crashing.
*   **Error Logging and Monitoring**: Critical errors should be logged and monitored, providing developers with the necessary information to diagnose and resolve issues promptly.
*   **Integration Tests for Error Handling**: Comprehensive integration tests should be in place to validate the error handling mechanisms across different scenarios.

### Technical Notes:

*   Consider implementing a centralized error handling middleware for the backend.
*   Utilize client-side error boundaries in React and React Native for UI error handling.
*   Implement exponential backoff for API retries.
*   Define clear error codes and messages for consistent error reporting.
