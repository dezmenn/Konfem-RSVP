## 4. Risk Management

This section identifies potential risks to the project and outlines a plan to mitigate them.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R01** | **Feedback Integration**: Delays caused by integrating feedback from user testing checkpoints. | Medium | Medium | Allocate buffer time after each testing checkpoint for revisions and bug fixes. |
| **R02** | **Algorithm Complexity**: The auto-arrangement algorithm may be more complex than anticipated, causing delays. | Medium | High | Begin with a simpler version of the algorithm and iterate; conduct early prototyping and testing. |
| **R03** | **Cross-Platform Sync**: Ensuring seamless and bug-free data synchronization between web and mobile. | High | High | Implement comprehensive integration tests; conduct thorough user testing on various devices and network conditions. |
| **R04** | **Third-Party Dependency**: Reliance on external services (e.g., WhatsApp API) that may change or become unavailable. | Low | High | Abstract third-party integrations to allow for easier replacement; have a backup plan for critical services. |
| **R05** | **Mobile Optimization**: Achieving a native-like, touch-optimized experience on mobile may be challenging. | Medium | Medium | Follow platform-specific design guidelines; conduct extensive user testing on mobile devices. |
