node test-responsive-design.js

# Offline Functionality
node test-offline-functionality.js
```

### Master Test Runner

Run all tests together:

```bash
node test-task-21-complete.js
```

## Test Reports

Each test script generates detailed JSON reports:

- `dashboard-analytics-test-report-[timestamp].json`

### Getting Help

If tests fail or you encounter issues:

1. Check the detailed JSON reports for specific error messages
2. Review the console output for warnings and errors
3. Verify all prerequisites are met
4. Test individual components in isolation
5. Check network connectivity and server status

## Next Steps

After completing Task 21 testing:

1. **Review Results:** Analyze all test reports and identify areas for improvement
2. **Address Issues:** Fix any critical failures or performance problems
3. **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from actual users testing the interfaces
4. **Iterate:** Make improvements based on test results and user feedback
5. **Document:** Update documentation with any discovered limitations or requirements

## Test Environment Notes

- Tests are designed to work with the demo environment
- Some features may require production-level infrastructure
- Mobile testing may require actual devices for complete validation
- Network conditions can affect test results
- Browser compatibility may vary
