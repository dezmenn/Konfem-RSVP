# USER TESTING CHECKPOINT: Venue and Table Management

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

This checkpoint validates the venue layout and table management functionality as specified in **Task 13** of the RSVP Planning App implementation plan. The testing covers:

- ✅ Set up demo venue with various layout elements
- ✅ Test venue element creation and positioning  
- ✅ Test table creation and capacity management
- ✅ Test drag-and-drop functionality for venue design
- ✅ Test table locking and unlocking features
- ✅ Collect feedback and iterate based on user input

## 📊 Demo Environment Status

### ✅ Successfully Created
- **8/8 Venue Elements**: Stage, Dance Floor, Bars, Entrance, Walkway, Decorations
- **8/8 Tables**: Various capacities (6-12 guests), positioned strategically
- **2 Locked Tables**: VIP Table and Family Table (for testing lock functionality)
- **Venue Validation**: Working with overlap detection (found 4 overlapping pairs)

### ⚠️ Partial Issues
- **Table Validation API**: Some 500 errors on validation endpoint
- **Capacity Info API**: Some 500 errors on capacity endpoint
- **Mobile Components**: Need gesture handling and responsive design improvements

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] All venue elements can be created, moved, and resized
- [ ] All tables can be created, moved, and configured
- [ ] Locking/unlocking functionality works correctly
- [ ] Validation detects and reports issues appropriately
- [ ] Capacity information is accurate and updates in real-time
- [ ] Drag-and-drop is smooth and responsive
- [ ] UI is intuitive and user-friendly
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

### Specific Test Cases
- [ ] Try to overlap elements and verify warnings
- [ ] Try to delete a table with assigned guests (should fail)
- [ ] Test locked table behavior during auto-arrangement
- [ ] Test capacity validation when reducing table size
- [ ] Test element library drag-and-drop functionality

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test invalid table positions (negative coordinates)
- [ ] Test invalid capacity values (0 or negative)
- [ ] Test network error scenarios (disconnect backend)
- [ ] Test concurrent editing scenarios

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Backend API Issues
- **Table Validation Endpoint**: Returns 500 errors
- **Capacity Info Endpoint**: Returns 500 errors
- **Root Cause**: Likely missing mock data or service implementation

### Mobile Component Issues
- **Gesture Handling**: Missing in TableManagement and IntegratedVenueManager
- **Responsive Design**: Needs improvement for mobile screens
